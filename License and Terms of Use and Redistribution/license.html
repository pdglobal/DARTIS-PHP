           <div><strong>END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order to protect (our "content", "data", "website", or any "content" generated by our "services" or "servers") and the members of our community, we need these end user license terms to set out some rules for downloading and using our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of. This license is a legal agreement between you and us (Progressive Dynamics Global Ltd Co) and describes the terms and conditions for using our content. We don't like reading license documents any more than you do, so we have tried to keep this as short as possible. If you break these rules we may stop you from using our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of. If we think it is necessary, we might even have to ask our lawyers to help out.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you buy, download, use or access our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of, you are agreeing to stick to the rules of these end user license agreement ("EULA") terms. If you don't want to or can't agree to these rules, then you must not buy, download, use or access our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of. This EULA incorporates the terms of use for the pdglobal.net website ("EULA"), our brand and asset usage guidelines, our privacy policy, and, our Arbitration Agreement. By agreeing to this EULA you also agree to all of the terms of the foregoing documents, so please read through them carefully.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>AGREEMENT TO THIS CONTRACT/EULA</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You agree to this CONTRACT/EULA by<br/><br/><strong>(A)</strong> Clicking "I agree" in our "software", or "website", or any derivation(s) of our "software", or "website".<br/><br/><strong>OR</strong><br/><br/><strong>(B)</strong>By using or accessing our "content", "data", "website", or any  generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", or any derivation(s) there-of.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Under the agreement, you agree to use a neutral arbitrator to decide any individual claims that may arise and thus agree to waive your rights to bring individual claims in court for consideration by a judge or jury. You also agree that class action lawsuits and class-wide arbitrations are not allowed under the terms of this agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>ONE MAJOR RULE</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we've made unless we specifically agree to it. By "distribute anything we've made" what we mean is:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>give copies of our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "website", "software", or "servers", and any deriderivation(s) there-of to anyone else;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>make commercial use of anything we've made;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>try to make money from anything we've made; or</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>let other people get access to anything we've made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><em><strong>unless</strong></em> we specifically agree to it. And so that we are crystal clear, "our content" or "what we have made" includes, but is not limited to, the client or the server software for our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of. It also includes updates, patches, downloadable content, add-ons, or modified versions of our content, part of those things, or anything else we've made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>USING OUR  "WEBSITE", "SOFTWARE", OR ANY "CONTENT" GENERATED BY OUR "SERVICES", "SOFTWARE", or "SERVICES", AND ANY DERIVATION(S) THERE-OF</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You have been granted a license to our content so you can access and use it, yourself, on your devices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Below we also give you limited rights to do other things. If you wish to make something pertaining to anything we've made we're humbled, but please make sure that it can't be interpreted as being official and that it complies with this EULA and the brand and asset usage guidelines and above all do not make commercial use of anything we've made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The license and permission we give you to use and access our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of can be revoked if you break any of the terms of this EULA.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you access our "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of, you receive a license that gives you permission to install our content on your own personal computer and use and access it on that computer as set out in this EULA. This permission is personal to you, so you are not allowed to distribute our content (or any part of it) to anyone else. This also means you cannot sell or rent our content, or make it available for access to other people and you cannot pass on or resell any license keys. You may however give gift codes that have been bought through our official gift code system. This is important to help us stop piracy and fraud and to protect our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of. It is also important to prevent members of our community from buying pirated versions of our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of or fraudulent license keys - which we may cancel, such as in the case of fraud.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hacked versions or Modded Versions of our "software" are not okay to distribute</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Essentially the simple rule is do not make commercial use of anything we've made unless we've specifically said it's okay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>OWNERSHIP OF OUR  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" GENERATED BY OUR "SERVICES", "SOFTWARE", or "SERVICES", AND ANY derivation(s) THERE-OF</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although we license you permission to install on your computer and access our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of, we are still the owners of it. We are also the owners of our brands and any content contained in our content. Therefore, when you pay for (or use) our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of, you are receiving a license to access / use our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of in accordance with this EULA. The only permissions you have in connection with our content and your installation of it are the permissions set out in this EULA.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

If you don't want to give us these permissions, do not make content available on or through our services. Please think carefully before you make any content available, because it may be made public and might even be used by other people in a way you don't like.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are going to make something available on or through our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of, it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and it must be your own creation. Some examples of the types of things you must not make available using our  "data", "website", "software", or any "content" generated by our "services", "software", or "servers", and any derivation(s) there-of include: posts that include racist or homophobic language; posts that are bullying or trolling; posts that are offensive or that damage our or another person's reputation; posts that include porn or someone else's creation or image; or posts that impersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit people.</div>

We are not responsible for any loss or damage that it may cause. You bear the entire risk as to its quality and performance. You have to accept that we may release contents well before they are complete and so they may (and often will) have bugs -but we prefer to release these features early than make you wait for perfection. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has or has not been advised of the possibility of such damages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
